* Clone this repository, from your local machine:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/adaltas/ece-webtech-2021-fall.git webtech
  cd webtech/courses/webtech/project
  ```
  
* Install [Go](https://golang.org/) and [Dex](https://dexidp.io/docs/getting-started/). For example, on Ubuntu, from your project root directory:   
  ```yaml
  # Install Go (linux)
  apt install golang-go
  # Install Go (macos)
  brew install go
  # Download Dex
  git clone https://github.com/dexidp/dex.git
  # Build Dex
  cd dex
  make build
  make examples
  ```
  Note, the provided `.gitignore` file ignores the `dex` folder.
  
* Now that Dex is built and configured, you can start the Dex server:
  ```yaml
  cd dex
  bin/dex serve dex-config/config.yaml
  ```
  
* Start the back-end
  ```bash
  cd back-end
  # Install dependencies (use yarn or npm)
  npm install
  # Optional, fill the database with initial data
  bin/init
  # Start the back-end
  bin/start
  ```
  
* Start the front-end
  ```bash
  cd front-end
  # Install dependencies (use yarn or npm)
  npm install
  # Start the front-end
  npm start
  ```
